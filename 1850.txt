Megan: How was your day?
Cueball: I visited the military aircraft museum over at the Air Force base. It was really neat!
Cueball: They have planes from different eras, all kinds of cool equipment, and you can even watch missiles being loaded.
Cueball: ...at least, I hope that was a museum.
Megan: Do you hear helicopters?
