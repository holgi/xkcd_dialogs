Megan: Ugh, everyone's an epidemiologist.
Megan: It's like when there's a mountaineering disaster in the news, and suddenly everyone is an expert on mountain climbing safety.
Cueball: I mean, it's not exactly like that.
Cueball: If the entire world's population were suddenly stranded on mountaintops together, a lot of people would understandably be trying to become mountaineering experts really fast.
Megan: Okay, that's fair.
Megan: But I do wish they wouldn't keep going on TV and saying "According to my research on gravity, if everyone curls into a ball and rolls, we'll get to the bottom quickly!"
Cueball: Yes, that's definitely not helping.
