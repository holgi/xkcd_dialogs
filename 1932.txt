Cueball: You’re looking festive.
Santa Hat: I love Christmas!
Cueball: Really? Doesn’t seem like your kind of thing.
Santa Hat: It’s our most meta holiday!
Cueball: How so?
Santa Hat: All our Christmas stories now are about discovering the “true meaning of Christmas.”
Cueball: Huh, yeah. And then sharing it with others.
Santa Hat: At some point, that quest itself became the true meaning.
Cueball: Like a word whose definition is “the act of looking up the definition of this word.”
Santa Hat: “Autometalogolex”?
Cueball: My least favorite of Santa’s reindeer.
