Megan: Just this apple, thanks.
Ponytail: That will be one dollar.
Megan: Exactly? No tax or anything?
Ponytail: That's right.
Ponytail: ...Is that a problem?
Megan: It's just weird to realize that every other transaction in my life will be more complicated than this.
Megan: This is like a platonic ideal exchange. An apple for a dollar.
Ponytail: I see.
Megan: Are we on a frictionless plane? Is a train leaving Chicago at 40 mph? Should I solve for something??
Ponytail: Okay, apples are $2.17 now.
Megan: That's... probably better for us both.
