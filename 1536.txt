Cueball: Ooh, trailer for The Martian!
White Hat: What's that?
Cueball: Movie of a book I liked.
White Hat: Should I read it?
Cueball: Depends. You know the scene in Apollo 13 where the guy says "we have to figure out how to connect this thing to this thing using this table full of parts or the astronauts will all die?
White Hat: Yeah?
Cueball: The Martian is for people who wish the whole movie had just been more of that scene.
White Hat: How on earth did that become a big-budget thing with Matt Damon?
Cueball: No idea, but I'm so excited.
