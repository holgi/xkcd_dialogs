Parent: No, you can't go.
Cueball: But all my friends-
Parent: If all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you jump too?
Cueball: Oh, jeez. Probably.
Parent: What!? Why!?
Cueball: Because all my friends did.
Cueball: Think about it - which scenario is more likely:
Cueball: Every single person I know, many of them levelheaded and afraid of heights, abruptly went crazy at exactly the same time...
Cueball: ...or the bridge is on fire?
Parent: ...I, uh...hmm.
Cueball: Imagine reading this on CNN: "Many fled their vehicles and jumped from the bridge. Those who stayed behind..."
Cueball: Is something good about to happen to those people?
Parent: Maybe they'll find cookies?
Cueball: OK, you stay. I'm jumping.
