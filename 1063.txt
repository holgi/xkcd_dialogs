Black Hat: I finished my time machine, but it's one-use-only.
Cueball: You gotta kill Hitler.
Black Hat: Why are you so obsessed with this Hitler guy? We have all of time we could explore!
Cueball: He's evil incarnate! He murdered millions and sparked global war! Everyone agreesâ€”if you get a time machine, you kill Hitler.
Black Hat: Fine, fine, I get it! Calm down. BRB, killing Hitler.
Black Hat: There. Done. Are you happy?
Cueball: Thank you.
Black Hat: He was in some kind of bunker. 1945 was loud!
Cueball: NO!
