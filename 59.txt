Blondie: What do you want to do when you graduate?
Megan: I want to become a lighthouse operator.
Blondie: Oh?
Megan: Yeah.
Megan: Lighthouses are built on interesting pieces of coast, so I'll have an interesting place to walk and swim, and great views of all kinds of weather. 
Megan: I'd feel good about myself and my work every single day.
Megan: I'd get to be the girl in the tower, only I'd be the one rescuing people.
Megan: Why, what do you want to do?
Blondie: I'm going to grad school. I don't really know why.
Megan: Wanna come hang in my lighthouse over breaks?
