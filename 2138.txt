Ponytail: Oh cool!
Ponytail: ...Wait, you wrote it?
Ponytail: Oh no.
Cueball: Wanna see the code?
Ponytail: I would, if you hadn't said that in the tone of voice of "Wanna see a dead body?"
Cueball: My code is sort of similar to a dead body, in that you can either come look at it now, or wait a few weeks until it becomes a problem.
Ponytail: And because you're lucky that the people around you understand that they create more problems than they solve.
