Patient: While you're doing the surgery, can you also implant this in my arm?
Surgeon: A USB port?
Patient: Just wire it up to some nerves.
Surgeon: ...This won't let your brain control USB devices, you know.
Patient: Sure - I just want the hardware.
Patient: The rest is software; I'm sure there will be a project to patch together support eventually.
Surgeon: Ah - you're a Linux user, I see.
Patient: Yeah, how'd you know?
