Off-panel voice: Uh oh.
Off-panel voice: Is this a normal bug, or one of those horrifying ones that prove your whole project is broken beyond repair and should be burned to the ground?

Off-panel voice: OK, what's the bug?
Cueball: The server crashes if a user's password is a resolvable URL.
Off-panel voice: I'll get the lighter fluid.
