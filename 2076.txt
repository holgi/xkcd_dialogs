White Hat: So you don't like any horror movies?
Cueball: Spooky stuff is neat but I hate jump scares and watching people get murdered.
Cueball: Why would you want to see that?
White Hat: It's like roller coasters. People like experiencing powerful feelings in a safe, controlled setting.
Cueball: But why not good feelings?
White Hat: We've always been into tragic stories. Romeo and Juliet, Titanic...
Cueball: See, that's another thing I don't get!
Cueball: I loved Titanic because Rose and Jack found each other and seemed so happy! I just hated the ending.
White Hat: I'll be sure to give James Cameron and Shakespeare your feedback.
