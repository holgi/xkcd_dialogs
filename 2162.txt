Megan: Literary opinion:
Megan: I firmly believe that William S. Burroughs, Hunter S. Thompson, Chuck Palahniuk, and David Foster Wallace are different names for the same person.
Cueball: ...I see.
Megan: Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Fight Club? Same book with different covers, I bet.
Cueball: I have both. Want to open them and check?
Megan: I do not.
Megan: Moving on: my next opinion--
Cueball: You should start a book club for discussing the books you refuse to read.
Megan: --is that E.B. White and T.H. White are the same person.
Cueball: Ok, that I believe.
