Megan: The internet is so overwhelming for me these days. It feels like everyone I know is yelling all the time.
Megan: That's why it's so nice to unplug. Leave the phones at home, go for a walk, and look up at the stars.
Megan: It helps you focus on what really matters.
Cueball: Like "Where the hell are we?"
Megan: And "Why did I leave my phone at home? It has my map and flashlight."
Cueball: "Are there mountain lions around here? Did you hear a twig break?"
Megan: Yeah, the big questions!
