Cueball: Spammers are breaking traditional Captchas with AI, so I've built a new system. It asks users to rate a slate of comments as "Constructive" or "Not constructive."
Cueball: Then it has them reply with comments of their own, which are later rated by other users.
Megan: But what will you do when spammers train their bots to make automated constructive and helpful comments?
Cueball: Mission . Fucking . Accomplished .
