Cueball: Magnus Carlsen has an app where you can play chess against a simulated version of him at different ages.
Cueball: I can beat the 8 1/2-year-old, but lose to him at 9.
Megan: I want that, but for other games.
Megan: Can I beat 8-year-old Serena Williams at Tennis? Swim laps faster than a 6-year-old Michael Phelps?
Cueball: We should make a simulator.
Cueball: ...Why limit it to games? Can I cook a better chicken than 11-year-old Martha Stewart?
Megan: Win an election against 12-year-old JFK?
Megan: Looks like 8-year-old Magnus Carlsen can swim faster than 9-year-old Martha Stewart.
Cueball: But they both lose a hot-dog-eating contest to 2-year-old Secretariat.
Megan: This project has gotten weird.
