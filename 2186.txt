Ponytail: Dark matter density in the solar system is around 0.3 GeV/cm3
Cueball: Is... that a lot?
Ponytail: In terms of mass, it means the Earth contains one squirrel worth of dark matter at any given time.
Cueball: Wow.
Cueball: Is there any way to find out which squirrel it is?
Ponytail: No, it's not literally-
Cueball: Oh, that explains why they weigh enough to set off those spinning bird feeders!
Ponytail: Dark matter isn't squirrels!
