Cueball: We linked up our observatories, got everything aligned, and there it was:
Cueball: The first image of a black hole!
Ponytail: Can you share the picture?
Cueball: Well, here's the thing...
Cueball: Turns out our telescope feed is like Pinterest, where you can't right-click to save an image.
Cueball: So we tried to take a screenshot, but the key combination kept turning off the display instead.
Cueball: I grabbed my phone and tried to take a picture of the screen, but I was too slow. The observation had ended.
Cueball: We're planning to try again next year, and we'll definitely record the screen this time.
