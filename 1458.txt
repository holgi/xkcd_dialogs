Luke Skywalker: He's heading for that small moon.
Ben Kenobi: That's no moon - it's a space station.
Luke Skywalker: It's too big to be a space station.
Ben Kenobi: But it's too small to be a moon.
Ben Kenobi: Fine! What if we agree it's not a moon, but we make a new category called "Dwarf Moon"?
Luke Skywalker: And what's the cutoff, asshole?! Is this ship a dwarf moon now?
Ben Kenobi: Screw you.
