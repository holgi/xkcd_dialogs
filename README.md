XKCD Dialogs
============

This repo contains some transcripts of Randall Munroes famous [xkcd][] comics.
These transcripts are mostly from the also incredible [explainxkcd][] wiki.
Some of these transcripts are lightly edited.

Why?
----

At the [35c3][] I've seen a very intriguing (and hopefully easy to build)
xkcd display by [Freies Labor Hildesheim][freieslabor]. And now I want to build
one myself.

The [repo of the display][display] will one day hopefully contain a build
instructions and the required software to run is. But please be patient, I'm
just starting this.
