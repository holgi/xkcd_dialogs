Guy: Have you read about Google HQ? It sounds like an incredible place to work.
Friend: Man, I ain't going to be chained down in no corporate idea factory!
Friend: They think just 'cause they've got a nice building and laid back culture, I'm gonna want to come in all day long and work on fascinating problems with the smartest people in the world.
Guy: So, what, they turned you down?
Friend: I don't understand it! I even baked them a cake shaped like the Internet!
