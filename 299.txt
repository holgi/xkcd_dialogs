Cueball: Maggie's gone. You can't bring her back.
Friend: But I have to, she's a part of my life.
Cueball: *sigh*
Cueball: Okay, let me put this in your terms.
Cueball: Remember when Aeris died in FFVII? It was sad, but you had to keep playing .
Friend: Actually, I downloaded a mod to add her back to my party.
Friend: It changed other character's appearances and dialogue to hers so you didn't have to lose her.
Friend: Lots of gamers did it.
Cueball: That is troubling on several levels.
Friend: I wonder if Maggie's old dresses would fit you.
