Ponytail: Well, we zapped you with energy beams, and it looks like one of your stupid organs is a traitor.
Cueball: ...which one?
Ponytail: I dunno, appendix? Gallbladder? One of the little ones that sucks.
Cueball: What should I do?
Ponytail: You could quash the revolt with the ruthless deployment of chemical and biological weapons.
Cueball: ...antibiotics?
Ponytail: But certain victory comes only through the sword.
Cueball: Surgery.
Ponytail: While we're inside, we'll look around-if we see any signs of insurrection elsewhere, we will not hesitate to act. 
Ponytail: There can be no armistice. 
Ponytail: Your parts must fall in line or be crushed.
Cueball: Um.
Ponytail: When the battle is won, we will salt your abdomen so no new organs can ever sprout up to trouble you again.
Cueball: Maybe I should get a second opinion.
Ponytail: Only if you care what a weaker doctor would say.
