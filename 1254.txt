Cueball: Sorry for the voicemail, but I'm confused about how to reach you.
Cueball: When I text you, you reply once on GChat, then go quiet, yet answer IRC right away. 
Cueball: I emailed you, and you replied on Skype and mentioned that the email "woke you up".
Cueball: You're very responsive - I just have no sense of how you use technology.
Cueball: ?!?
Note: did you try to call me? use my google voice number next time.
