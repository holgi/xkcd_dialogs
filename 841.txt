Cueball: Do we have an RCA-to-3.5mm female-female plug? I'm getting some speakers for the new Xbox, since the monitor doesn't have any.
Megan: Are they crappy laptop speakers? Ugh.
Cueball: Does it matter? I just want to hear if I'm getting shot at, not savor every detail of a beautiful musical soundscape.
Megan: You've never heard a beautiful musical soundscape. You listen to 96kbps flv rips from YouTube.
Cueball: Whatever. I'm just going to get these $20 speakers. Five watts will be plenty.
Megan: Five watts for a living room sound system? Is that a joke?
Cueball: No, this is a joke: How many audiophiles does it take to change a lightbulb?
Megan: How many?
Cueball: I'll tell you laterâ€”you wouldn't appreciate the punchline over this 12kbps cell phone codec.
