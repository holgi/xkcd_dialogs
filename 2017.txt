Host: Welcome back to stargazing.
Host: When the stars disappeared this morning, I figured I had to find a new job, but they're back! This rules!
Host: Those three stars form a constellation called the triangle.
Host: Those three are another triangle.
Host: Lotta triangles. Very important shape.
Host: Those dots are planets, or "fool's stars." Without interstellar travel, they're the only ones we can realistically hope to dump trash on.
Host: Speaking of space trash, that dot is a satellite. There are apps that will tell you whose fault it is.
Off-panel voice: What's that blinking one?
Host: Airplane. They're full of snacks and money and stuff, but don't bother trying to catch them- they're way too high up.
Host: Learned that the hard way in grad school.
Host: Got a thesis out of it, at least.
