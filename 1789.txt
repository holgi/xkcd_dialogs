Cueball: I have five phone numbers for you. Which one should I use?
White Hat: That first one is my cell - you should use the Google Voice one, since it will forward to my laptop if I'm on WiFi. 
White Hat: #5 is my work number, which just forwards to #1. #3 should always work but can't do texts.
White Hat: You can delete #4. I think.
