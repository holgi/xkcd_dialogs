Girl: Do you remember before the internet?
Megan: Oh yeah, totally.
Girl: what was it like?
Megan: Not having a phone or computer to distract you?
Girl: Yeah.
Megan: It was SO. BORING. All the time. I just sat there. It was the worst.
Girl: But wasn't it, like, more fulfilling? Engaging?
Megan: Wasn't worth it.
Girl: I still get bored.
Megan: Not like we did.
