Megan: Ever hear of the Kola Borehole?
Black Hat: Noâ€”what's that?
Megan: A Soviet project to drill deep into the Earth's crust.
Megan: There's a hoax report claiming that their drill broke through into a superhot cavern, and when they lowered a microphone into the hole, they heard tormented screaming. 
Megan: People say that's why the miners sealed the well and abandoned the project.
Black Hat: Why would anyone believe that story?
Megan: I guess some people think Hell is literally an underground place.
Black Hat: No - I mean, why would the miners seal the opening?
Black Hat: Why not just dig a canal connecting it to the ocean? 
Black Hat: Unless they like Hell.
Megan: ...If there's ever a war between Earth and Hell, I hope I'm on your side.
Black Hat: You seem nice; you probably won't be.
