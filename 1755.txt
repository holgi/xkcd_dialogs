Cueball: What were things like in the old days?
Cueball: I hear that you had to ... compile things for different processors?
Hairbun: Yeah
Hairbun: To compile your code, you had to mail it to IBM.
Hairbun: It took 4-6 weeks.
Hairbun: Before garbage collection, data would pile up until the computer got full and you had to throw it away.
Hairbun: Early compilers could handle code fine, but comments had to be written in assembly.
Hairbun: C could only be written on punch cards.You had to pick a compact font, or you'd only fit a few characters per card.
Hairbun: C++ was big because it supported floppy disks.

Cueball: Wow.
