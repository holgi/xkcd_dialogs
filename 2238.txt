Ponytail: Yesss, I got my flu shot.
Cueball: Nice! I got mine a few weeks ago.
Cueball: Immunity buddies!
Ponytail: Now I can finally get bitten by all the bats I want!
Cueball: No, that's rabies, that's not what-
Ponytail: I'll be able to roll and play in the poison ivy without a care in the world!
Cueball: Why would you do that even if the shot did-
Ponytail: No more slathering on sunscreen. No more rushing for antivenom after a snakebite. 
Ponytail: And now I can stop wasting time boiling contaminated water before drinking it!
Ponytail: Gonna click on every URL in every email I get, even the ones with IP addresses and weird Unicode in them!
Cueball: You know what, sure, go for it.
