Ponytail: Our robot floats using a helium sphere, which is highly charged and can induce lightning strikes.
Ponytail: It moves using a grappling gun like the hook shot from Zelda.
Cueball: What is the robot for?
Ponytail: Uh
Ponytail: It could help with search and rescue after disasters.
Cueball: "It could help with search and rescue" is engineer-speak for "we just realized we need a justification for our cool robot."
