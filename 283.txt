Megan: Argh, movie pet peeve- Someone sitting at a computer in the dark with the screen projected on their face. Monitors don't work like that!
Cueball: Right - that only happens if you're in the way of a projected image. 
Cueball: Like when we're sitting together in a parked car in the rain and the mottled light through the raindrops on the windshield makes shifting shadows on your skin...
Megan: ...I wasn't really into the movie anyway.
Cueball: The nearest rainstorm's about 60 miles away.
Megan: We'll drive fast.
Cueball: I'll grab some snacks.
