Cueball: The average head has about 100,000 hairs.
Cueball: And hair grows at about 1/2" per month. Plus or minus.
Ponytail: Okay...
Cueball: So our heads are producing an inch of hair every minute.
Ponytail: I see. I'm just glad it's evenly distributed. 
Ponytail: It would suck if we grew a single new five-foot-long hair every hour.
Cueball: Hmm, would the hair grow steadily, or would it suddenly shoot out 5 feet on the hour?
Ponytail: If the latter, what noise would it make?
Ponytail: Ziiip? Pwiff?
Cueball: Fwip?
Ponytail: Blip.
Cueball: Zhooop.
Ponytail: Pew!
