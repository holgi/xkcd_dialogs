Megan: Did you see the neutrino speed of light thing?
Cueball: Yup! Good news; I need the cash.
Megan: Huh? Cash?
Cueball: No, this isn't about whether relativity exists. If it didn't, your GPS wouldn't work.
Cueball: What do you mean, "science thought police"? Have you seen our budget? We couldn't begin to afford our own thought police.
Megan: That sounds miserable and unfulfilling.
Cueball: Yup. So I gave up, and now I just find excited believers and bet them $200 each that the new result won't pan out.
Megan: That's mean.
Cueball: It provides a good income, and if I'm ever wrong, I'll be too excited about the new physics to notice the loss.
