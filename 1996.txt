Megan: Every morning, before my eyes even focus all the way, I read a bunch of infuriating national news stories and bad opinions. I wonder what this is doing to my brain.
Megan: It's probably not great.
Hairbun: Back in my day, we had to pay people to print out infuriating news stories and bring them to our door. 
Hairbun: And we waited until we had stumbled out to the kitchen to read them.
Hairbun: Totally different.
Megan: OK, fair. But newspapers at least had more local news mixed in, right?
Hairbun: Yeah, true.
Megan: I bet they weren't full of bad opinions.
Hairbun: Yyyyyes.
Hairbun: All our opinions were good. It was a remarkable time.
Hairbun: Please don't go check.
