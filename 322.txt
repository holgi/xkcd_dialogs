Black Hat: Hi. I'm here about the girl who visited your IRC channel last night looking for Java help.
Cueball: What did you do to my door?
Black Hat: When someone with a feminine username joins your community and you say "OMG a woman on the Internet" and 'jokingly' ask for naked pics, you are being an asshole. 
Black Hat: You are not being ironic. You are not cracking everybody up.
Black Hat: You are the number one reason women are so rare on the Internet.
Black Hat: At least, the parts of it you frequent.
Black Hat: As someone who likes nerdy girls, I do not appreciate this. 
Black Hat: I'm here to ban you from the Internet. 
Black Hat: The gal behind me with the EMP cannon is Joanna - she'll be assigned to you for the next year. 
Black Hat: Try to go online and she'll melt your PC.
Cueball: Dude, she's hot. Is she single?
Black Hat: Joanna, fire.
