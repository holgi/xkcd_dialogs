Cueball: Hey, will you be in town the day after Christmas?
Friend: Couldn't say-
Friend: I'm Jewish.
Cueball: But... how does being Jewish keep you from knowing your plans?
Friend: I know my plans-
Friend: I just don't know when Christmas is.
Cueball: Really? Why not look it up?
Friend: Well, I'm also a physicist.
Cueball: So?
Friend: I believe that since I don't observe Christmas, it can't have a definite date.
