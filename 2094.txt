Ponytail: It's like when you promise your firstborn to a witch for five magic beans.
Cueball: Is that a common-
Ponytail: She's a sucker, right? You know your awful kid will be worth one or two beans at best.
Ponytail: But then it turns out you love your kid, a love worth 200 beans! You can't afford that loss!
Ponytail: There's only one way out:
Ponytail: You gotta fight the witch.
Ponytail: So you send your kid up the beanstalk to battle the giant, who represents interest rates.
Cueball: This analogy is getting less helpful by the minute.
Ponytail: If only you'd somehow shorted my wisdom before you asked.
