Cueball: Hey, Dr. Nash, I think those gals over there are eyeing us. This is like your Nash Equilibrium, right? 
Cueball: One of them is hot, but we should each flirt with one of her less-desirable friends. Otherwise we risk coming on too strong to the hot one and just driving the group off.
Dr. Nash: Well, that's not really the sort of situation I wrote about. 
Dr. Nash: Once we're with the ugly ones, there's no incentive for one of us not to try to switch to the hot one. It's not a stable equilibrium.
Cueball: Crap, forget it. Looks like all three are leaving with one guy.
Dr. Nash: Dammit, Feynman!
