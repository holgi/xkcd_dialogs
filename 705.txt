Phone: Excellent.
Criminal: But then this guy climbed up the ventilation ducts and walked across broken glass, killing anyone we sent to stop him.
Phone: And he rescued the hostages?
Criminal: No, he ignored them. He just reconnected the cables we cut, muttering something about "uptime".
Phone: Shit, we're dealing with a sysadmin .
