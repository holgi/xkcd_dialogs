Cueball: So that's the coronavirus genome, huh?
Megan: It is!
Cueball: It's weird that you can just look at it in a text editor.
Megan: It's essential!
Megan: We geneticists do most of our work in Notepad.
Cueball: Notepad?
Megan: Yup! Nicer labs use Word, which lets you change the genome font size and make nucleotides bold or italic.
Cueball: Ah, okay.
Megan: That extra formatting is called "epigenetics".
Cueball: Hey, why does that one have a red underline?
Megan: When we identify a virus, we add its genome to spellcheck. That's how we spot mutations.
Cueball: Clever!
