Cueball: I'm sick and I'm scared.
Friend: Well, remember - having a good attitude is the most important thing. Think positively and you'll get better.
Cueball: So if I'm sad or afraid or feel like crap sometimes, then...
Friend: ...then if you don't recover, it will be your fault.
Cueball: Well that makes me feel even worse.
Friend: See? You're doing this to yourself.
Cueball: No!
Friend: Stop it!
Cueball: Argh!
Cueball: Okay, you know what? Screw this. My attitude isn't my problem. - My disease is my problem, and I'm treating it.
Cueball: I'm going to be glum and depressed and pessimistic some days, and I'm going to get better anyway.
Cueball: Wait, that ended up sounding optimistic.
Friend: I guess you suck at pessimism.
Cueball: Maybe I'll be better at it tomorrow.
