Megan: There are these orchids whose flowers look like female bees. When males try to mate with them, they transfer pollen.
Megan: This orchid - Ophrys Apifera - makes flowers, but no bees land on them because the bee it mimics went extinct long ago.
Megan: Without its partner, the orchid has resorted to self-pollinating, a last-ditch genetic strategy that only delays the inevitable. 
Megan: Nothing of the bee remains, but we know it existed from the shape of this flower.
Megan: It's an idea of what the female bee looked like to the male bee...
Megan: ...as interpreted by a plant.
Beret Guy: Wow, so...
Beret Guy: I'll remember your bee, orchid. I'll remember you.
