Ponytail: Making friends is so much harder once you're out of school.
Ponytail: Everyone's so busy. And how do you even meet people?
Cueball: Here's what I do:
Cueball: I pretend to be weak and injured, and wait for others to start circling, hoping to take my food, shelter, and nutrients.
Cueball: Then, before they can descend, I start telling them cool facts about space until they like me.
Cueball: Bam, friendship!
Ponytail: This explains a lot.
