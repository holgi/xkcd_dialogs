Friend: What DVD is this?
Cueball: Blade Runner. I got it for Christmas.
Friend: The one with Harrison Ford, right? And the Olsen twins?
Cueball: Yeâ€” What? Olsen twins? No, this is the 80's sci-fi classic!
Friend: Huh. I didn't know the Olsen twins even did sci-fi.
Cueball: ...They don't.
Friend: So is Ashely the replicant, or is Mary-Kate? I can never tell them apart.
Cueball: Neither! They're not in this movie!
Friend: Then who is?
Cueball: Daryl Hannah!
Friend: I liked her in Full House.
Cueball: I hate you.
Friend: Man, this movie is just a New York Minute rip-off.
