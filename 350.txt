Cueball: Pretty, isn't it?
Megan: What is it?
Cueball: I've got a bunch of virtual Windows machines networked together, hooked up to an incoming pipe from the net. 
Cueball: They execute email attachments, share files, and have no security patches.
Cueball: Between them they have practically every virus.
Cueball: There are mail trojans, warhol worms, and all sorts of exotic polymorphics.
Cueball: A monitoring system adds and wipes machines at random. 
Cueball: The display shows the viruses as they move through the network. Growing and struggling.
Megan: You know, normal people just have aquariums.
Cueball: Good morning, Blaster. Are you and W32.Welchia getting along?
Cueball: Who's a good virus? You are! Yes, you are!
